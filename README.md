# MVVM+RxSwift Sensor App
An iOS project implementing MVVM pattern in Swift and using sensor data provided by CoreMotion to do so. Very much a work in progress.

Thanks to @popei69 https://github.com/popei69 for this tutorial https://benoitpasquier.com/integrate-rxswift-in-mvvm/ and the corresponding example project.
